//! The safety authority.
//!
//! **It owns the only write handle to the robot.** Nothing above it — not the policy, not
//! the arbiter, not a client — holds a [`RobotIo`], so nothing above it *can* command a
//! motor. The invariant is enforced by the borrow checker rather than by a rule someone has
//! to remember when adding the eighth skill the night before a demo.
//!
//! That is the same argument the updater makes about its recovery path: code that only runs
//! once something has already gone wrong is the code most likely to be quietly broken, so
//! make the broken state unrepresentable instead.
//!
//! Two rules, unconditional:
//!
//!  - **Non-finite rejection.** A `NaN` target is not clamped, it is refused outright.
//!  - **Range clamp.** Targets are held inside the actuator's travel.
//!
//! Plus a deadman on the command itself: if intents stop arriving, the velocity goes to
//! zero. **Stop is not limp** — losing comms makes the robot *stand still*, because standing
//! is the safe state for a biped; losing balance is a different event, and it is not this
//! layer's to answer.
//!
//! **The fall verdict is a report, not a rule.** [`Safety::fallen`] is tracked every tick
//! and published, and it preempts nothing: a fallen robot keeps being driven and the
//! humans stay in charge. That is the prototype's behaviour, and it is the only one — a
//! robot that yields the moment gravity misreads a lean is a robot that keeps sitting down
//! while someone handles it.
//!
//! What to *do* about a fall is a control decision, and it lives above this layer:
//! `robotd`'s limp-fall mode drops the gain and rides the robot down, on
//! [`crate::fall::FallPredictor`] rather than on this verdict. It commands through `apply`
//! like anything else, with no exemption and no back door — which is the point of the
//! write handle living here.

# Put the Space's Hugging Face runtime variables in the page, then serve it.
#
# This is what `telepresence`'s `server.mjs` does, and what the playground Space does since it had
# the same fault this one had. A `sdk: static` Space is served with a `window.huggingface.variables`
# object spliced into its `<head>` — the OAuth client id, the scopes the app was provisioned with,
# the provider URL — and Hugging Face's own client libraries read the sign-in out of it. A
# `sdk: docker` Space gets those values as environment variables and no injection at all, so the
# container does it.
#
# Reproducing the whole object, rather than substituting one value into a placeholder, is what
# lets the page ask for the scopes the app actually has instead of the ones it guessed. It also
# keeps the property the placeholder was chosen for: the injection is ours, out of this
# container's own environment, and depends on nothing on Hugging Face's side that can silently
# stop happening.
#
# `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` is in this environment too and is deliberately not in the list below. The
# browser flow is PKCE and needs no secret; the client id authorises nothing and is public.

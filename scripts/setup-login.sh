# **A script rather than three functions in `install.sh`, because `install.sh` runs once.** It sets
# up a board and is never seen again, and the update path cannot reach it — it is not in the
# artifact. All three of these were added to `install.sh` alone, so none of them is on any board
# that has only ever updated: `docs/design/updater-design.md` §9.1 in its fourth shape, found by
# ssh'ing to a robot whose release contained the prompt feature and getting the stock prompt.
# `install.sh` and `hooks/postinstall` both run this now, which is the shape `setup-gstreamer.sh`
# already had.
#
# Idempotent, and meant to be run on every update: each step rewrites its file, which is what
# makes a board provisioned two months ago end up with what a board provisioned today has.
#
# Nothing here is needed for the robot to run. A board with no /etc/profile.d, no motd machinery
# or no bash-completion skips that step; `hooks/postinstall` treats a failure as cosmetic, because
# a shell prompt is not worth rolling an update back for.

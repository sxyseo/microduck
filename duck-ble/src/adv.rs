//! What the advertisement carries besides the name: the robot's IPv4 address.
//!
//! Platform-independent, and here rather than in [`crate::bluez`] for [`crate::gatt`]'s reason —
//! it is wire contract. The robot encodes with [`address_data`] and `duckctl` decodes with
//! [`address_in`], so the two halves cannot disagree about the layout. A decoder written
//! separately in the client would agree only with itself.
//!
//! ## Why the advertisement rather than a call
//!
//! `net.status` already reports the address, and reading it costs a connection, a bond and the
//! PIN — per robot. `duckctl scan` deliberately connects to nothing, which is what makes it the
//! command to reach for when a robot is unreachable, so a listing can only report what an
//! advertisement carries. Broadcasting the address is therefore the only way `scan` can answer
//! "where do I ssh?", and that is the question a listing is most often read to answer.
//!
//! ## Why four bytes and no more
//!
//! A legacy advertisement holds **31 bytes**, and `btd` already spends 21: flags (3) and a
//! 128-bit service UUID (2 + 16). One manufacturer-data field costs 2 for its header and 2 for the
//! company id, so the payload has 6 bytes to live in and this one uses 4. The name is not in that
//! budget — BlueZ puts a Local Name in the scan response, which has 31 bytes of its own.
//!
//! That is the whole reason the SSID is not here too: an SSID is up to 32 bytes on its own, so no
//! version of it fits. It stays a `wifi status` question.
//!
//! ## Why the address is always present
//!
//! A robot with no wifi advertises [`Ipv4Addr::UNSPECIFIED`] rather than dropping the field. The
//! field is then evidence in itself: absent means a robot on a release that predates this, present
//! and zero means a robot that has no address, and those two want different next moves. Dropping
//! the field would collapse them into one blank column.
//!
//! ## The extended twin carries one byte more
//!
//! `btd` puts the same payload on the air twice: once as a legacy advertisement and once as an
//! extended one, because the robot's controller cannot take a connection from a central that offers
//! channel selection algorithm #2 over a legacy advertisement (`app-path-design.md` §3.8). The two
//! arrive from different random addresses, so to a scanner they are two peripherals with the same
//! name — which `duckctl` refuses as a collision unless it can tell they are one robot.
//!
//! [`EXTENDED_MARK`] after the address is how it tells. The extended advertisement has no 31-byte
//! budget, so the byte costs nothing there, and the legacy payload is unchanged.
